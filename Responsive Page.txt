google font is another one,
can't load as much images as you want and what size images.
788KB is WAY too big.

Optimize any images

LOAD image, state it's width, stated sexless/no units.
Make sure images load fast, with the right size to load into.
So width and height is a good idea.
Now you have a box to fit into

img{width: 100%;
	height: auto;}
USED IN EVERY image that instructor uses for website. To position it in container with correct aspect ratio.
Really concerned about bandwidth, have SEPARATE image for MOBILE. Load mobile FIRST. If no mobile, it will ALSO download second image, loading 2 images it's
so minimal for PCs, and on MOBILE you won't be loading the big one.
Source to hold MULTIPLE images.
srcset is what ACTUALLY loads the images, in the srceset u have to write the WIDTH in a NON-traditional manner, put w at the end of it.
srcset is a media query in an html code.
Gotta make a lot more images.
It can increase your cost, for images to manipulate, would double image costs.
Old method, one image maybe two.
New methond, 4 or maybe 5 images.

Doesn't increase much css code. Can ignore gradient.
Almost never throw a full size image in there.
Because Aspect Ratio of images, Most important image is below the fold.
Load image specify width and height and sexless
div image containers with 100% and height auto, you'll be fine.
This technique always works and media query to fix everything else.
One of the number of techniques that works out there.
