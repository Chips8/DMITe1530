wixx, godaddy are all templates, all are pretty much the same. They make okay sites, not good sites.
Boiler plate = starting point
Boiler point will grow
Boiler point updated: Include with all the things you need.
Things in specific order, make it fast.
Stuff out of date = not include material = not gonna work.
Boiler plate last year = different from this year.
Folder name is intuitive
UNIX system: All caps, so he can tell difference.
Language = english right in beginning = load time faster
This is all about speed.
utf-8 = keyboard and language

		<meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible"> is for compatibility with chrome
- no need for html.shiv anymore, it's built into javascript
Title has to be unique and relate to content.
If not, search engine will point you lower.
Title tag is change me? = lose marks, I guess it means he will label it as change me?
<meta name="viewport">


all manipulates browser before <meta name="viewport">
all manipulates viewport

make sure initial scale is 1:1, always goes from landscape to portrait all the time.
Everything 

2 different theories on reset
normalize.css = gone away from it.
It's doing more than just normalizing and resetting CSS
They reset everything to 0 or 100% on default.
Everything starts off at same size, so you can manipulate them from what you want it to design.
It was initially made for a word processor.

He uses Eric Meyers

Spent more time removing stuff in normalization.CSS
You can use either or, but make sure you use the latest one

2philosiphy of clear fix
clear fix then
group camp came out after clear fix

not interested in IE 6 or 7, if customer uses it, then will charge extra
came out in 2002, not worried about supporting ancient material.

When you float you take it to float to bubble to top,
pins or anchors object inside those little thumb tacs you put into there.

Why put code, why load it if not using it.

Named appropriately to what it is after CSS = website link
Keep it more simantic and the world becomes so simple. We don't have birds.css but we will, to reduce confusion
Don't have to say what type of style sheet it is anymore

Javascript sets behaviors
So many peices of code that may not work right in IE but looks stupid in firefox but looks good in chrome
piece of script called modernizr
use a bunch of detects
interrupts the code so it works loosely and consistantly among itself
If not using flexbox WHY add them?
Add only what you need.
IN beginning you don't know what you're using.
So he's built us a complete package of modernizer in session 2

Taking out spaces = reduces speed
ms saves and gets added up
Takes IE 7 or older versions of chrome and fixes it.
jquery a bunch of javascript to add transition to slide shows
just using normal jquery
no need for type in script anymore either.
Last thing that loads outside of footer = script
** highlight text + ctrl + / = comment **
min = minimized file
WE don't need jquery till everything is used, right now we won't but later we will.
This is base starting zone.
Never had a website without a header,main, or footer.
grid design, 3 column grid
1 column, flush right rigid left = one column
traditional grid to assymetrical grid
grids don't necessary line up
makes it more appealing
makes it a bit harder to design page, but it allows you to be efficient using grid layout but modifiying it for viewport
especially large viewport to small viewport
containers hold content
content = objects itself

No period = not paragraph then it is a header

All containers objects have headings

not heading, not paragraph, if it's ordered then it must be a list. 3 unique content in my page.
3 sections of content. if only one section you don't need to use it in main.
2 not distinct content at top.
Headings don't have 2 parts, but lists do.
3 different lines = lists.
3 types of list dl, ul, and ol
2 different tags you can target without needing to do anything else
 
quickly mark up content = organizing everything
** highlight+ alt+shit+w **
Learn short cuts for tool you are using 


use 2 lists because using 2 different CSS
if not re-using don't use class, class is not used as styling hooks.
font takes 7 arguements in 9 different ways
arial works on every machine out there
not gonna manipulate body because 3 objects that need center-lined
960 is based on grid design
will go over grid later
easily dividable by 9, 6, 4 etc easy for nice looking grids
equally displaces left and right with margin: 0 auto; and needs specified width
bunch of variations on padding.
top 40 left auto bottom 0 right auto

inside specified container, they can't break
float left and space them dynamically so they beside each other.
This designed is constrained don't have to worry.
default line size in reset so now everything should align with vertical-align:top for image of phone and phone number

** ctrl + highlight each line + shift+alt+w to make a list for EACH line! **

960 - 20 left padding and - 20 right padding = 920
920 - 20 - 20 = 880 /3 = 293.333
pxiel is abstract number
different from monitor to monitor
want to use relative numbers
All numbers should be the same.
margin-fix is to fix/remove the last one.
If there is more than twice, A have to change CSS or B create a class to save code.
Everything means something.
Don't need styling book.
