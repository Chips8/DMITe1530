everything is read sequentially


* aterics everything, ranking power of 0
html is a tag, ranking power of 1, more specific
div has a power of 10
main p{
has ranking of 4.
99% of the time in style sheets

if class on p tag = 14 points.
Why some code is applied and some is not base on power ranking.
avoid using !mportant, always over rides cascade ++, adds one.

target element
<p title = "phoo">
property and the value
can target tags with different properties or values
Targetting an objects value, gives ability to target anything on the page.
Only gonna use it once, don't need a class.
most p tags end up having titles anyways
a lot of pseudo classes, apply pseudo class to p tags and treat it like a list.
So many ways to do it.

ADVERTISEMENT* is <aside>
can make it can load into a 1024px screen and not get overloaded/ can fit on the screen.
add-on: windows resizer
allows me to flop between 1024px page and dial it down to 768px
full class header
Most corporate are designed this way for users to find things and updated all the time.
Headers and footers don't get changed all the time, but the content does.
System that is scalable and flexible.
some css to apply high definition pictures.
Targetting in a modular way= targetting multiple things with one statement or one object

body {background:url(../images/Yellowhead.jpg) no-repeat center center fixed;
		background-size: cover;}
Make sure image scales itself to whatever screen you want, so using short hand is location and repeat
repeat is the default, so use no-repeat.
center or 50%
fixed = screen will move but image won't move
background-size: cover allows for that attachment
using multiple properties for one object
If you want multiple objects in one object then what?
Base image = last image in one object:
body {
	background-image:url(../Images/number-1.png),
					 url(../Images/number-2.png),
					 url(../Images/number-4.png),
					 url(../Images/number-5.png),
					 url(../Images/Yellowhead.jpg);

	background-repeat: no-repeat;

	background-position:top left,
						bottom left,
						top right,
						bottom right,
					 	center center;

	background-size: auto, auto, auto, auto, cover;
	background-attachment: fixed;
}
Can attach onto html, then body. Make it a composite image.
