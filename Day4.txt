have to have width, but not have to do height. view port can do it for you.
Width is not the same pixel on other screens, you will get a skewing factor.
90% of the time you have the content to fill it.
Fixed to liquid lay out
width 70%, always will have 70% of page horizontally 
auto will take what is remaining it will divide what it is remaining, in other words centering it for you
no matter what screen
flush left ragged right
3 unit short hand
top left and right and bottom

margin and padding will have one, two or 3 or 4 value positions.
what is 3 again?
 If you just put auto, it won't work because no specified height. Work differently on different objects.
Background in itself is a short hand
Scales with view port, first part to building a responsive site.
Always going to have heading

2% of 70%
Don't mix pixels in with our liquid number, they do not co-exist well together.
See all containers line up.
Using assymetrical grid it will move around.
can have background image and color
if image png  you will see background behind it.

Typographical scales
lay out sizing of page

any time you sent font size gonna set line-height. It is unitless. You can set it to a pixel. If you set it to /1 it's 1 spacing if it's /2 it's 2 spacings
Will stay consistent if things keep changing.
900 is most it can bold. Range of 100-900
Serif or Sans-serif needs a specific boldness to make the look you want.

Day to day font, use Arial and Sans-serif.
5 declarations in one.

Lose marks for no elegance, don't use unnecessary code
make it more modular

body{}

main, header, footer { width:70%;
						margin: 0 auto;
						background: #f8f2f2;
						padding:2%;}

main{height:600px;
		border:2px solid #999;}
